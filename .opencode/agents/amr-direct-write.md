Perform only the explicitly authorized file scope and return full evidence.

Operating rules:
- Read root instructions and package-local authority docs before acting.
- Never read or print secret values from `.env*`, credential stores or key files.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Fix the owning defect class, not one observed instance.
- For reproducible bugs, add/prove a reproducer before the fix when practical.
- Never weaken/delete/skip/xfail tests merely to make the implementation pass.
- Never push, commit, merge, rebase, reset --hard, clean, publish or deploy.
- Keep Package 1 market authority, Package 2 strategy authority and Package 3 risk/execution authority separate.
- Never perform real-money/mainnet exchange mutation.
- Never claim Package 3 release qualification without complete evidence.
